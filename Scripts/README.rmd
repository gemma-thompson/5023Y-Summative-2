This project is about male and female butterflies taken over the years
of 1880 - 1973 from museums. This data was alongside the average
temperature and rainfall in the month of June data.

The first thing that i decided to do was create a script to tidy the
data. This included a variety of code to make sure that the data had no
missing values, checked for no NA values, cleaned column names, and
individually looked at the different columns to check that the data
overall didnt have missing values. I finished this off using the quick
summary function to do an overall check on the data. The packages that i
used for this were: library(tidyverse) library(here) library(janitor)

Next i created an exploratory data analysis script. I visuliaed the data
by looking at the sex of the butterflies with all the numerical dats:
year, forewing lenthg, mean temperature in June and rainfall in June.
After creating my first graph (looking at the realtionship between sex
and year) i realised that there were 4 valuables in the sex column when
i actually only wanted two, so this enabled me to then be able to fix
this so it changed from: "Maes", "Males", "Female", "Females" to just
"Male" and "Female". I then continued to create the other graphs to look
for differences and uncertainty in the data. The other that i came
across was the outlier data value in the forewing length column of
577.0, so i removed this row from my data in order to remove the
anomoly. The packages that i used for this were: library (tidyverse)
library(tidyr) library(readr) library(ggplot2) library(dplyr)
library(knitr) library(here) library(kableExtra)

After this i created a linear models script. i created lsmodel1 which is
looking at two different data sets that directly relate to the
butterflies: sex and forewing length. I used a variety of functions such
as broom::tidy, performance::check_model, emmeans and summary to look
more closely at this data and created graphs such as the
Quantile-Qunatile plot and Cooks distance to check that outliers no
longer existed after i had explored it. This once again, gave me a
better insight into the data that i was working with. The packages that
i used were: library(tidyverse) library(GGally) library(emmeans)
library(performance)

Using all three scripts and analysing the data i used these graphs to
create a hypothesis for my Markdown file. Hypothesis: The temperature
and rainfall doesn't have an effect on the forewing length of male and female butterflies.
The null hypothesis goes against this and states that:
the temperature and rainfall has an effect on the forewing length of male and female butterflies.
